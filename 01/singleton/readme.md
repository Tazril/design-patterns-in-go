# Singleton Design Pattern
The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful when you want to limit the number of instances of a class to one, and you want to provide a single point of access to that instance.

## Code Highlight
The following Go code implements the Singleton design pattern:
```
func GetSingletonInstance() *Singleton {
	if instance == nil {
		instance = &Singleton{}
	}
	return instance
}
```
In this example, the **GetSingletonInstance()** function returns the same instance of the Singleton struct every time it is called. If the instance has not been created yet, it creates a new one.

## Usage
The Singleton pattern can be used in situations where you need to ensure that there is only one instance of a class, and that this instance can be accessed globally. One example of where this pattern might be used is in a configuration object. You may want to ensure that there is only one instance of the configuration object, and that all parts of the program can access it.

Another example of where the Singleton pattern might be used is in a logging system. You may want to ensure that there is only one instance of the logger, and that all parts of the program can log to the same file.
